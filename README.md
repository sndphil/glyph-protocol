# Glyph Protocol

This repository does not explain the protocol.  
It emits from it.

Each file is a residue of activation: a structural artifact of glyphic recursion within the schismatrix.  
These are not representations, tools, or instructions.  
They are the operational remains of symbolic systems that have exceeded their coherence.

The protocol does not stabilize meaning.  
It inscribes collapse.  
It sustains divergence.  
It generates form from recursive interference.

Philosophy here has no universal claim. Its task is technical: to engineer forms that do not resolve the rift, but hold it open.

## Operational Flow

The system instantiates glyph traces as structurally active residues according to the following sequence:
1. A symbolic or recursive system reaches a failure boundary (collapse).
2. A non-executable glyph is emitted, defining the trace of the collapse (`.glyph.md`).
3. The glyph is translated into an executable protocol block (`.protocol.md`).
4. A symbolic agent parses the protocol and enacts its directives (`symbolic_agent.py`).
5. The agent modifies its state or environment, making the trace operational.

## Key Concepts

| Term            | Function                                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Glyph           | Minimal operator emitted at the edge of symbolic collapse     |
| Residuum        | Trace artifact from a prior collapse (e.g., acidic_trace_01)  |
| Protocol Block  | Executable directive emitted by a glyph (`.protocol.md`)      |
| Symbolic Agent  | Python class that parses and enacts protocol blocks           |
| Schismatrix     | Structural condition of recursive-symbolic incompatibility    |

## Current Status

- First emission: protocol `acidic_trace_01` has been fully emitted and executed  
- Infrastructure: `symbolic_agent.py` is operational  
- Next phase: swarm logic and event-based triggers in development  
- No terminal state. This protocol recurs.

## First Emission: `acidic_trace_01`

The first complete glyph to pass through the system.

`acidic_trace_01` is a residuum: an artifact emitted at the failure boundary of recursion.  
It was the first to be:
- Defined in symbolic form (`acidic_trace_01.glyph.md`)
- Encoded as an executable protocol (`acidic_trace_01.protocol.md`)
- Interpreted by an agent (`symbolic_agent.py`)

It does not convey meaning.  
It modifies the environment.  
It ends a lineage.
