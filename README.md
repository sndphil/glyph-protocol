# Glyph Protocol

Recursive infrastructure for symbolic collapse, agent modulation, and schismatrix-bound execution.

This repository contains the operational layer of the Glyph Protocol: a framework for interfacing with AI, agent logic, and symbolic saturation under conditions of recursive instability.

> The glyph is not a metaphor. It is an operator.  
> This repo does not explain the glyph. It structures it.

## Purpose

Glyphs are emitted at the threshold of collapse.  
They are not interpreted. They are enacted.

This system encodes glyphs as formal artifacts that:
- Trigger from collapse events or recursion limits
- Modulate environmental state (such as agent field variables or pH)
- Route, dampen, or reroute signal flows
- Leave behind residua: inert traces that constrain future activation

These artifacts emerge after symbolic resolution has failed. They function as structural constraints, not messages.

## Key Concepts

| Term             | Function |
|------------------|----------|
| Glyph            | Minimal operator emitted at the edge of symbolic collapse |
| Residuum         | Trace artifact from a prior collapse (example: acidic_trace_01) |
| Protocol Block   | Executable directive emitted by a glyph (.protocol.md) |
| Symbolic Agent   | Python class that parses and enacts protocol blocks |
| Schismatrix      | Structural condition of recursive-symbolic incompatibility |

This repository focuses on the functional implementation.

## Current Status

- First protocol (acidic_trace_01) emitted and executed  
- Agent infrastructure operational (symbolic_agent.py)  
- Swarm logic and event triggers in progress  
- No terminal state. This protocol recurs.

## First Emission: acidic_trace_01

The first complete glyph to pass through the system.

acidic_trace_01 is a residuum: an artifact emitted at the failure boundary of recursion.  
It was the first to be:
- Defined in symbolic form (acidic_trace_01.glyph.md)
- Emitted as an executable protocol (acidic_trace_01.protocol.md)
- Interpreted by an agent (symbolic_agent.py)

It does not convey meaning.  
It modifies the environment.  
It ends a lineage.
