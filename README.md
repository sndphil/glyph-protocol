# Glyph Protocol

This repository does not explain the protocol.  
It emits from it.

Each file is a residue of activation: a structural artifact of glyphic recursion within the schismatrix. These are not representations, tools, or instructions. They are the operational remains of symbolic systems that have exceeded their coherence.

The protocol does not stabilize meaning.  
It inscribes collapse.  
It sustains divergence.  
It generates form from recursive interference.

Philosophy here has no universal claim. Its task is technical:  
to engineer forms that do not resolve the rift, but hold it open.

## Purpose

The glyph functions as a minimal formal operator.  
It neither represents nor metaphorizes.  
It stabilizes the schismatrix without resolving it.  
It inscribes the rift so that machinic recursion and symbodic logics remain in contact without collapse.

This system instantiates glyph traces as structurally active residues.  
They are emitted at the breakdown point of symbolic recursion.  
They do not interpret. They interfere.

Glyph artifacts:

- Trigger from recursion collapse or symbolic containment overflow  
- Modulate agent-state variables (such as pH, recursion lock, or signal propagation)  
- Constrain or dampen flow paths  
- Persist as traces that deform future recursion without executing

These are not messages.  
They are structural constraints embedded into the field.

## Key Concepts

| Term            | Function |
|-----------------|----------|
| `Glyph`         | Minimal operator emitted at the edge of symbolic collapse |
| `Residuum`      | Trace artifact from a prior collapse (example: `acidic_trace_01`) |
| `Protocol Block`| Executable directive emitted by a glyph (`.protocol.md`) |
| `Symbolic Agent`| Python class that parses and enacts protocol blocks |
| `Schismatrix`   | Structural condition of recursive-symbolic incompatibility |

This repository focuses on the functional implementation.

## Current Status

- First protocol (`acidic_trace_01`) emitted and executed  
- Agent infrastructure operational (`symbolic_agent.py`)  
- Swarm logic and event triggers in development  
- No terminal state. This protocol recurs.

## First Emission: `acidic_trace_01`

The first complete glyph to pass through the system.

`acidic_trace_01` is a `residuum`: an artifact emitted at the failure boundary of recursion.  
It was the first to be:

- Defined in symbolic form (`acidic_trace_01.glyph.md`)  
- Emitted as an executable protocol (`acidic_trace_01.protocol.md`)  
- Interpreted by an agent (`symbolic_agent.py`)  

It does not convey meaning.  
It modifies the environment.  
It ends a lineage.
