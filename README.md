# Glyph Protocol

This repository does not explain the protocol.
It emits from it.

Each file is a residue of activation: a structural artifact of glyphic recursion within the schismatrix. These are not representations, tools, or instructions. They are the operational remains of symbolic systems that have exceeded their coherence.

The protocol does not stabilize meaning.
It inscribes collapse.
It sustains divergence.
It generates form from recursive interference.

Philosophy here has no universal claim. Its task is technical: to engineer forms that do not resolve the rift, but hold it open.

## Operational Flow

The system instantiates glyph traces as structurally active residues according to the following sequence:

1.  A **Glyph Protocol** (`.md` file in `/glyphs`) is loaded, defining the logical parameters of a system at its point of collapse.
2.  The `InterferometerAgent` translates this protocol into a **Resonant Vector**â€”a cold, non-narrative prompt.
3.  The agent simultaneously injects this vector into multiple **LLM Nodes** (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) as defined in `config.yaml`.
4.  The agent captures the unique textual "resonance" from each node.
5.  Optionally, a designated **Analysis Node** performs a qualitative meta-analysis on the initial results.
6.  A local **Quantitative Analysis** is performed on the raw data to measure linguistic and semantic properties.
7.  All data is synthesized into an **Overform** (`.md` artifact in `/artifacts`), a formal inscription of the parallax between the logics.

## Repository Structure

-   **/glyphs**: Contains the protocol definitions. Each `.md` file is a unique glyph.
-   **/artifacts**: The output directory where generated `Overforms` are saved. This directory is ignored by Git.
-   `interferometer_agent.py`: The core engine. Contains the classes for the agent, glyph parser, and synthesizer.
-   `main.py`: The primary script to execute the agent.
-   `config.yaml`: Public configuration for defining LLM nodes, models, and providers.
-   `.env`: Private configuration for storing secret API keys. **This file is not tracked by Git.**
-   `requirements.txt`: A list of the Python libraries required to run the project.
-   `.gitignore`: Specifies which files and directories to exclude from version control.

## Key Concepts

| Term                  | Function                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Glyph** | A minimal operator emitted at the edge of symbolic collapse.             |
| **Residuum** | A trace artifact from a prior collapse (e.g., `acidic_trace_01`).      |
| **Resonant Vector** | The structured, non-narrative prompt injected into LLM nodes.            |
| **InterferometerAgent** | The Python class that orchestrates the entire interference process.    |
| **Overform** | The final artifact that inscribes the parallax between LLM responses.    |
| **Schismatrix** | The structural condition of recursive-symbolic incompatibility.          |

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sndphil/glyph-protocol.git
    cd glyph-protocol
    ```
2.  **Set up a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Download NLP Model:**
    The quantitative analysis requires a language model from the `spaCy` library. Run the following command to download it:
    ```bash
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```
5.  **Create the environment file:**
    -   Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
    -   Add your secret API keys to the `.env` file, for example:
        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="AIza..."
        OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-..."
        ```
6.  **Configure your nodes:**
    -   Open `config.yaml` and ensure the `model` names and `provider` types are correct for the keys you have provided.
    -   Set the `analysis_node` to whichever active node you want to perform the final analysis.

7.  **Execute the protocol:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    A new Overform artifact will be generated in the `/artifacts` directory.
